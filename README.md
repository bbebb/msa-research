This repository contains a research paper I conducted in late January of 2023, studying various Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) around the United States. Based on the data manipulated and claculated, I work to provide a concrete solution for individuals of the lowest economic quintile in their twenties to move into the highest economic quintile by their thirties.

The accompanying .rmd file carries out all calculations and executables needed to produce the results referenced in the paper.
